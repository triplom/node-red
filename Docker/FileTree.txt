Dockerfile which copies in local resources
It can sometimes be useful to populate a Node-RED Docker image with files from a local directory (for example, if you want a whole project to be kept in a git repo). To do this, youâ€™ll want your local directory to look like this:

Dockerfile
README.md
package.json     # add any extra nodes your flow needs into your own package.json.
flows.json       # the normal place Node-RED store your flows
flows_cred.json  # credentials your flows may need
settings.js      # your settings file
